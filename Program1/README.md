This program includes seven classes, in which 5 of these classes have OOP relationships with eachother. Class "Module" is the base class at the very top of the hierarchy, containing similar functions that its three derived classes will use: ability to change titles of videos/ events/ assignments, and ability to display the titles of these data members. Derived from Module are three child classes, LectureVideos, Assignments, and ScheduledEvents. These three classes each have their own functions that are specific for their own class, and each of these classes have their own job and purpose: they bring assignment, event, and video functionality to the program. Derived from the assignment class is a Node class that includes the pointers to manage the next pointer for a array of linked lists. There are seperate classes assignment manager and TimeDate, that manage the assignments in the LLL and manage the time/ date functionalities respectively. The program as a whole resembles something like Canvas or D2L.
